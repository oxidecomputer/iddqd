Maps where keys are borrowed from values.

This crate consists of several map types, collectively called **ID maps**:

* [`IdOrdMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_ord_map/imp/struct.IdOrdMap.html): A B-Tree based map where keys are borrowed from values.
* [`IdHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_hash_map/imp/struct.IdHashMap.html): A hash map where keys are borrowed from values.
* [`BiHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/bi_hash_map/imp/struct.BiHashMap.html): A bijective (1:1) hash map with two keys, borrowed from
  values.
* [`TriHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/tri_hash_map/imp/struct.TriHashMap.html): A trijective (1:1:1) hash map with three keys, borrowed
  from values.

## Usage

* Pick your ID map type.
* Depending on the ID map type, implement [`IdOrdItem`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_ord_map/trait_defs/trait.IdOrdItem.html), [`IdHashItem`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_hash_map/trait_defs/trait.IdHashItem.html),
  [`BiHashItem`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/bi_hash_map/trait_defs/trait.BiHashItem.html), or [`TriHashItem`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/tri_hash_map/trait_defs/trait.TriHashItem.html) for your value type.
* Store values in the ID map type.

### Features

This crate was built out a practical need for map types, and addresses
issues encountered using Rust’s default map types in practice at Oxide.

* Keys are retrieved from values, not stored separately from them. Separate
  storage has been a recurring pain point in our codebases: if keys are
  duplicated within values, it’s proven to be hard to maintain consistency
  between keys and values. This crate addresses that need.
* Keys may be borrowed from values, which allows for more flexible
  implementations. (They don’t have to be borrowed, but they can be.)
* There’s no `insert` method; insertion must be through either
  `insert_overwrite` or `insert_unique`. You must pick an insertion
  behavior.
* For hash maps, the default hasher is [`foldhash`](https://docs.rs/foldhash/0.1.5/foldhash/index.html), which is much faster
  than SipHash. However, foldhash does *not provide the same level of HashDoS
  resistance* as SipHash. If that is important to you, you can use a different
  hasher. (Disable the `default-hasher` feature to require a hash
  builder type parameter to be passed in.)
* The serde implementations reject duplicate keys.

We’ve also sometimes needed to index a set of data by more than one key, or
perhaps map one key to another. For that purpose, this crate provides
[`BiHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/bi_hash_map/imp/struct.BiHashMap.html) and [`TriHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/tri_hash_map/imp/struct.TriHashMap.html).

* [`BiHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/bi_hash_map/imp/struct.BiHashMap.html) has two keys, and provides a bijection (1:1 relationship)
  between the keys.
* [`TriHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/tri_hash_map/imp/struct.TriHashMap.html) has three keys, and provides a trijection (1:1:1
  relationship) between the keys.

As a consequence of the general API structure, maps can have arbitrary
non-key data associated with them as well.

### Examples

An example for [`IdOrdMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_ord_map/imp/struct.IdOrdMap.html):

````rust
use iddqd::{IdOrdItem, IdOrdMap, id_upcast};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

// Implement IdOrdItem so the map knows how to get the key from the value.
impl IdOrdItem for User {
    // The key type can borrow from the value.
    type Key<'a> = &'a str;

    fn key(&self) -> Self::Key<'_> {
        &self.name
    }

    id_upcast!();
}

let mut users = IdOrdMap::<User>::new();

// You must pick an insertion behavior. insert_unique returns an error if
// the key already exists.
users.insert_unique(User { name: "Alice".to_string(), age: 30 }).unwrap();
users.insert_unique(User { name: "Bob".to_string(), age: 35 }).unwrap();

// Lookup by name:
assert_eq!(users.get("Alice").unwrap().age, 30);
assert_eq!(users.get("Bob").unwrap().age, 35);

// Iterate over users:
for user in &users {
    println!("User {}: {}", user.name, user.age);
}
````

Keys don’t have to be borrowed from the value. For smaller `Copy` types,
it’s recommended that you use owned keys. Here’s an example of using
[`IdOrdMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_ord_map/imp/struct.IdOrdMap.html) with a small integer key:

````rust
struct Record {
    id: u32,
    data: String,
}

impl IdOrdItem for Record {
    // The key type is small, so an owned key is preferred.
    type Key<'a> = u32;

    fn key(&self) -> Self::Key<'_> {
        self.id
    }

    id_upcast!();
}

// ...
````

An example for [`IdHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_hash_map/imp/struct.IdHashMap.html), showing a complex borrowed key. Here,
“complex” means that the key is not a reference itself, but a struct that
returns references to more than one field from the value.

````rust
use iddqd::{IdHashItem, IdHashMap, id_upcast};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Artifact {
    name: String,
    version: String,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

// The key type is a borrowed form of the name and version. It needs to
// implement `Eq + Hash`.
#[derive(Eq, Hash, PartialEq)]
struct ArtifactKey<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    version: &'a str,
}

impl IdHashItem for Artifact {
    // The key type can borrow from the value.
    type Key<'a> = ArtifactKey<'a>;

    fn key(&self) -> Self::Key<'_> {
        ArtifactKey { name: &self.name, version: &self.version }
    }

    id_upcast!();
}

let mut artifacts = IdHashMap::<Artifact>::new();

// Add artifacts to the map.
artifacts
    .insert_unique(Artifact {
        name: "artifact1".to_owned(),
        version: "1.0".to_owned(),
        data: b"data1".to_vec(),
    })
    .unwrap();
artifacts
    .insert_unique(Artifact {
        name: "artifact2".to_owned(),
        version: "1.0".to_owned(),
        data: b"data2".to_vec(),
    })
    .unwrap();

// Look up artifacts by name and version.
assert_eq!(
    artifacts
        .get(&ArtifactKey { name: "artifact1", version: "1.0" })
        .unwrap()
        .data,
    b"data1",
);
````

#### `Equivalent` and `Comparable`

An important feature of the standard library’s maps is that they allow any
borrowed form of the key type to be used for lookups; for example, a
`HashMap<String, T>` type can be looked up with a `&str` key. This is done
through the [`Borrow`] trait.

But the [`Borrow`] trait is a bit too restrictive for complex keys such as
`ArtifactKey` above, requiring workarounds such as [dynamic
dispatch](https://github.com/sunshowers-code/borrow-complex-key-example). To
address this, the crates.io ecosystem has standardized on the [`Equivalent`](https://docs.rs/equivalent/1.0.2/equivalent/trait.Equivalent.html)
and [`Comparable`](https://docs.rs/equivalent/1.0.2/equivalent/trait.Comparable.html) traits as generalizations of `Borrow`. The map types in
this crate require these traits.

For a key type `T::Key<'_>` and a lookup type `L`:

* The hash map types require `L: Hash + Equivalent<T::Key<'_>>`. Also, `L`
  must hash in the same way as `T::Key<'_>`. Typically, this is done by
  ensuring that enum variants and struct fields are in the same
  order[^proptest].
* [`IdOrdMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_ord_map/imp/struct.IdOrdMap.html) requires `L: Comparable<T::Key<'_>>`, which in turn requires
  `Equivalent<T::Key<'_>>`. (There’s no need for `L` to implement `Ord` or
  `Eq` itself.)

[^proptest]: We recommend that you test this with e.g. a property-based
    test: see [this
    example](https://github.com/sunshowers-code/borrow-complex-key-example/blob/a6f17699/src/lib.rs#L233).

Continuing the `ArtifactKey` example from above, we can perform a lookup
using a key of this owned form:

````rust
use equivalent::Equivalent;

// This is an owned form of ArtifactKey. The fields are in the same
// order as ArtifactKey's fields, so it hashes the same way.
#[derive(Hash)]
struct OwnedArtifactKey {
    name: String,
    version: String,
}

impl Equivalent<ArtifactKey<'_>> for OwnedArtifactKey {
    fn equivalent(&self, other: &ArtifactKey<'_>) -> bool {
        self.name == other.name && self.version == other.version
    }
}

// Now you can use OwnedArtifactKey to look up the artifact.
let owned_key = OwnedArtifactKey {
    name: "artifact1".to_owned(),
    version: "1.0".to_owned(),
};
assert_eq!(artifacts.get(&owned_key).unwrap().data, b"data1",);
````

There’s a blanket implementation of [`Equivalent`](https://docs.rs/equivalent/1.0.2/equivalent/trait.Equivalent.html) and [`Comparable`](https://docs.rs/equivalent/1.0.2/equivalent/trait.Comparable.html) for
[`Borrow`], so if your type already implements [`Borrow`], there aren’t any
extra steps to take.

## Testing

This crate is validated through a combination of:

* Unit tests
* Property-based tests using a naive map as an oracle
* Chaos tests for several kinds of buggy `Eq` and `Ord` implementations
* Miri tests for unsafe code

If you see a gap in testing, new tests are welcome. Thank you!

## No-std compatibility

Most of this crate is no-std compatible, though [`alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/index.html) is required.

The [`IdOrdMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_ord_map/imp/struct.IdOrdMap.html) type is not currently no-std compatible due to its use of a
thread-local. This thread-local is just a way to work around a limitation in
std’s `BTreeMap` API, though. Either a custom B-Tree implementation, or a
platform-specific notion of thread locals, would suffice to make
[`IdOrdMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_ord_map/imp/struct.IdOrdMap.html) no-std compatible.

## Optional features

* `serde`: Enables serde support for all ID map types. *Not enabled by
  default.*
* `schemars08`: Enables [`schemars`] support for all ID map types. *Not enabled by
  default.*
* `daft`: Enables [`daft`](https://docs.rs/daft/0.1.3/daft/index.html) support for all ID map types. *Not enabled by
  default.*
* `std`: Enables std support. *Enabled by default.*
* `default-hasher`: Enables the `DefaultHashBuilder` type. Disable this
  feature to require a hash builder type parameter to be passed into
  [`IdHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/id_hash_map/imp/struct.IdHashMap.html), [`BiHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/bi_hash_map/imp/struct.BiHashMap.html), and [`TriHashMap`](https://docs.rs/iddqd/0.3.4/iddqd/tri_hash_map/imp/struct.TriHashMap.html). *Enabled by default.*
* `allocator-api2`: Enables support for custom allocators via the
  [`allocator_api2`](https://docs.rs/allocator-api2/0.2.21/allocator_api2/index.html) crate. Both global and scoped/arena allocators
  (such as `bumpalo`) are supported. Custom allocators are not currently
  supported by `IdOrdMap`.

## Related work

* [`bimap`](https://docs.rs/bimap) provides a bijective map, but does not
  have a way to associate arbitrary values with each pair of keys. However,
  it does support an ordered map type without the need for std.

* [`multi_index_map`](https://crates.io/crates/multi_index_map) provides
  maps with arbitrary indexes on fields, and is more flexible than this
  crate. However, it doesn’t expose generic traits for map types, and it
  requires key types to be `Clone`. In `iddqd`, we pick a somewhat different
  point in the design space, but we think `multi_index_map` is also great.

* In general, this is similar to relational database records with
  indexes. For sufficiently complex use cases, consider an embedded
  database like [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), or even a networked
  database like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). `iddqd` is a
  good fit for simple in-memory caches of data stored in these databases.

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

This crate’s MSRV is **Rust 1.81**. In general we aim for 6 months of Rust
compatibility.

## What does iddqd mean?

The name `iddqd` is a reference to [a cheat
code](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_cheat_codes) in the classic video game
*Doom*. It has `id` in the name, and is short and memorable.
