/// A mutable reference to an [`IdOrdMap`] entry.
///
/// This is a wrapper around a `&mut T` that panics when dropped, if the
/// borrowed value's key has changed since the wrapper was created.
///
/// # Change detection
///
/// It is illegal to change the keys of a borrowed `&mut T`. `RefMut` attempts
/// to enforce this invariant, and as part of that, it requires that the key
/// type implement [`Hash`].
///
/// `RefMut` stores the `Hash` output of keys at creation time, and recomputes
/// these hashes when it is dropped or when [`Self::into_ref`] is called. If a
/// key changes, there's a small but non-negligible chance that its hash value
/// stays the same[^collision-chance]. In that case, the map will no longer
/// function correctly and might panic on access. This will not introduce memory
/// safety issues, however.
///
/// It is also possible to deliberately write pathological `Hash`
/// implementations that collide more often. (Don't do this.)
///
/// Also, `RefMut`'s hash detection will not function if [`mem::forget`] is
/// called on it. If a key is changed and `mem::forget` is then called on the
/// `RefMut`, the [`IdOrdMap`] will no longer function correctly and might panic
/// on access. This will not introduce memory safety issues, however.
///
/// The issues here are similar to using interior mutability (e.g. `RefCell` or
/// `Mutex`) to mutate keys in a regular `HashMap`.
///
/// [`mem::forget`]: std::mem::forget
///
/// [^collision-chance]: The output of `Hash` is a [`u64`], so the probability
/// of an individual hash colliding by chance is 1/2⁶⁴. Due to the [birthday
/// problem], the probability of a collision by chance reaches 10⁻⁶ within
/// around 6 × 10⁶ elements.
