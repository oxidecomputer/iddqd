# Changelog

## [0.3.4] - 2025-06-03

### Added

- New macros `id_hash_map`, `bi_hash_map`, `tri_hash_map`, and `id_ord_map` allow easy construction of literal macros. These macros use `insert_unique`, so they panic if duplicate keys are encountered.

### Changed

- The `id_upcast`, `bi_upcast` and `tri_upcast` macros now have a `Self: 'long` bound, allowing them to be used for non-`'static` items.
- Minimized dependency list, removing the dependency on `derive-where`, `debug-ignore`, and serde's `derive` feature. iddqd no longer depends on any proc macros.

## [0.3.3] - 2025-05-27

### Added

- A lot of new documentation. Most functions now have doctests.

### Fixed

- Serde implementations no longer do internal buffering.
- Serde implementations now reserve capacity if the size hint is available; thanks [@aatifsyed](https://github.com/aatifsyed) for your first contribution!
- A few unnecessary bounds have been loosened.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-05-24

### Added

- The hash map types now support custom hashers.
- With the new `allocator-api2` feature (enabled by default), the hash map types now support custom allocators, including on stable. See [the bumpalo-alloc example](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/iddqd/blob/940c661095cf23c97b4769c9e0fdf9b95e9a7670/crates/iddqd-extended-examples/examples/bumpalo-alloc.rs#L31).
- Added some documentation explaining iteration order.
- Added a note in the README and `lib.rs` that small copyable keys like integers are best returned as owned ones.

### Changed

- Dropped the `Ord` requirement for `Comparable` keys. (The `Hash` requirement for `Equivalent` continues to be required.)

## [0.3.1] - 2025-05-22

### Added

- Re-export `equivalent::Equivalent` and `equivalent::Comparable`.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-05-22

### Changed

- Lookups now use [`equivalent::Equivalent`] or [`equivalent::Comparable`], which are strictly more general than `Borrow`.
- `get_mut` and `remove` methods no longer require the key type; the borrow checker limitation has been worked around.

[`equivalent::Equivalent`]: https://docs.rs/equivalent/1.0.2/equivalent/trait.Equivalent.html
[`equivalent::Comparable`]: https://docs.rs/equivalent/1.0.2/equivalent/trait.Comparable.html

## [0.2.1] - 2025-05-22

### Fixed

* `MapLeaf<'a, T>`'s `Clone` and `Copy` no longer require `T` to be `Clone` or `Copy`. (`MapLeaf` is just a couple of references, so this is never necessary.)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-21

### Added

- `Extend` implementations.

### Changed

- Daft implementations for `BiHashMap` and `TriHashMap` changed to also allow diffing by individual keys.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-05-21

### Added

- `BiHashMap` and `TriHashMap` now have a `remove_unique` method which removes an item uniquely indexed by all keys.

### Changed

* `upcast` macros are now annotated with `#[inline]`, since they're trivial.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-21

### Added

- [Daft](https://docs.rs/daft) implementations with the new `daft` feature.
- `BiHashItem` implementations for reference types like `&'a T` and `Box<T>`.
